Configuring Samba for file and printer sharing on a Fedora server involves several steps. Samba
is a popular open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is
used for sharing files and printers between Windows and Linux systems. Here's a step-by-step
guide on how to set up Samba on your Fedora server.

### Install Samba

Ensure that Samba is installed on your Fedora server. You can use the dnf package manager to
install it if it's not already installed.

```bash
sudo dnf install samba
```
### Configure your firewall
You need to allow Samba traffic through your firewall. You can use firewalld to configure your
firewall rules.
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=samba
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=139/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permane
```
### Create a Samba user
Samba requires user accounts for authentication. You can create a Samba user that corresponds to
an existing Linux user.
```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a your_username
```
Replace your_username with the name of the Samba user account that you want to create.
You'll be prompted to set a password for this Samba user.

### Create a Samba share directory
```bash
sudo mkdir /path/to/share
```
Replace /path/to/share with the path to the directory that you want to share.

### Configure Samba's smb.conf
The main configuration file for Samba is smb.conf. You can find this file in /etc/samba/smb.conf.
You should create a backup of this file before making changes.
```bash
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak
```
Edit the smb.conf file with your preferred text editor
```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```
Example smb.conf configuration file.
```bash
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
security = user
map to guest = Bad User
[share_name]
path = /path/to/shared/folder
browseable = yes
read only = no
valid users = your_username
```
Replace share_name with the name of the Samba share directory, path/to/share with the path to
the directory that you want to share, and your_username with the name of the Samba user account
that you created.

Save the file and exit the editor. Restart the Samba service.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smb.service
```
### Test the Samba configuration
Test your Samba configuration for syntax errors.
```bash
testparm
```
If no errors are reported, your configuration is valid.

Start and enable Samba services
Start and enable the Samba service so that it runs at boot.
```bash
 sudo systemctl start smb
 sudo systemctl enable smb
```
Once you have completed these steps, you will be able to access the Samba share directory from
Windows clients on your network. To configure Samba for printer sharing, you will need to add
the following lines to the /etc/samba/smb.conf file:
```bash
[printers]
path = /var/spool/samba
printable = yes
guest ok = no
```
Save the file and exit the editor. Restart the Samba service.
Connect to the Samba share

From a Windows or Linux client, you can connect to the Samba share by browsing the network or
using the smbclient command. For example:
```bash
smbclient //server_name/share_name -U your_username
```
You can also access the share from a Windows computer by entering \\server_name\share_name
in the file explorer.

`Note: Remember to to customize the configuration to match your specific needs and security
requirements.`
